# markdown-it-references
A purpose-built implementation of footnotes for markdown-it.rs. Unlike some other implementations, footnotes are placed
where you placed them in the source Markdown document, rather than always at the bottom.

Footnotes can be referenced using `[^footnote-id]` and defined on their own line using `[^footnote-id]: Footnote contents`
